====> DB ===> tables ==> mapping ==> real DataBase

====> software  ==> 
xamp  => https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
 laragon => https://laragon.org/download 


 ============> sql  ===> standared query language 
 ====> query ==> quires 


 ========================>
 1- Create DataBase ==> Create database dbName 
 ===> Create database iti_summer_2025_g1
2- delete, drop database ==> drop database bdName
====> drop database iti_summer_2025_g1

*********************************  tables
 2- Create tables ===> 1- you must enter in Db 
 Create table tableName (columns of table) 
 ===> Create table department (id int primary key  , name varchar (50), not null)
 primary key ===> unique , not null 
 auto increment ==> default value ==> 1 


 2- CREATE TABLE department_location (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    location VARCHAR(60),
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES department(id)
);

3- CREATE TABLE employee (
    ssn INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(60),
    address VARCHAR(60),
    gender emun("male","female")
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES department(id),
    emp_ssn INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (emp_ssn) REFERENCES employee(ssn)
);

============>project : name , num (key) , location , dep-num 
4-CREATE TABLE project (
    num INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
      name VARCHAR(60),
    location VARCHAR(60),
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES department(id)
);
=====================> employee project
5- CREATE TABLE employee_project (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    project_num INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (project_num) REFERENCES project(num),
    emp_ssn INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (emp_ssn) REFERENCES employee(ssn)
);

=======================> dependants
6- CREATE TABLE dependants (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(60),
    BD date,
    gender enum("male","female"),
    relation_ship VARCHAR(60),
    emp_ssn INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (emp_ssn) REFERENCES employee(ssn)
);

************************* delete table 
drop table table name



******************************  insert data in table 

insert into department (id , name) values(3,"mearn")
===> id ==> auto increment ==> insert into department ( name) values("mearn")


*******************  select data from table
 ==> select all data => select * from department
 ==> select specific column ==> SELECT name from department;

 ====> table select columns ==> with another name ==> alias

SELECT name  as department_name from department ;

====> select ==> by condition 
SELECT name  as department_name from department where id > 1;
SELECT id as department_num, name as department_name from department where id > 1;
SELECT id , name  from department where id > 1;

condition in range 

SELECT id , name  from department where id  between 2 and 4;==>2,3,4
SELECT id , name  from department where id  in (2 , 4); ===> 2,4

***************************************** select data by order ==> desc , asc  ===> defulat 
SELECT * FROM `employee` ORDER by ssn DESC;


=========================================> update data in table 
update employee set name ="ayaat"  ===> name ==> values ==> ayaat

====> update ==> condition 
update employee set name ="ayaat" where id=1


==========> and , or , not 
and ==>  two condition = true 
update employee set BD="2000-08-12" where name="ayaat" and ssn=1

or ==> on of two conditions is true
update employee set BD="2000-08-10" where name="ayaat" or ssn=5

not ==> not id =1 ==> any id except 1

====================================>

aggregiation functions ==> min , max , avg , sum , count

select sum(ssn) from employee
select sum(ssn) as sum_ssn from employee

select min(ssn) from employee
select min(ssn) as min_ssn from employee

select max(ssn) from employee
select max(ssn) as max_ssn from employee

select count(ssn) from employee
select count(ssn) as count_ssn from employee

select avg(ssn) from employee
select avg(ssn) as avg_ssn from employee


====================> like 
select * from name where name like "a%"  ==> start with a
select * from name where name like "%a%"  ==> a is in center
select * from name where name like "%a"  ==>end with a



====================================> update strucure of table ===> column ===> alter

-- add colum in table emp_projects work_hours
alter table employee_project add hours int default 0

---> delete column
alter table employee_project drop column test


=========> add constrain colum ==> nuique , not null
alter table project add constraint uniqueName unique (name)

=========> rename table 
Alter table employee_project rename to emp_projects
